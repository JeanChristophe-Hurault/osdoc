title: ESCoP 2017 workshop

There will be an OpenSesame workshop as a pre-conference event before ESCoP 2017!

Registration is free! But we do ask that you register, so that we know how many people to expect. You're also welcome if you don't attend ESCoP itself (although, if you're there, chances are that you're there for the conference).

You can use the same registration link to register for the [JASP](http://jasp-stats.org/) workshop.
